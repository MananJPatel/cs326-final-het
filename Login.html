<h1>Welcome to Media Sense!</h1>
<p><br> In the age of Fake News and Targeted Marketing, we believe that consuming news isn't enough. It is imperative for a healthy democracy that we become conscious of the media we consume.  
<br><br>Media Sense analyzies media houses on their bias and reliablity and assigns scores to them. On our website, you can search for these media houses and view their bais from partisan-left to partisan-right, their reliability score based on the validity of the information they provide, as well as a list of entities the media houses intentionally talk more or less about. You can add these entities on your watchlist and monitor their data as well.
