# Idea:
Media analysis. One thing we found very interesting is how differently the news is reported amongst media companies. For example, Fox News favors everything that Donald Trump does and paints a very likable picture of him whereas MSNBC does the exact opposite. This results in a massive polarization amongst the populace of a country which is not healthy for a democracy. 
How news is reported differs in countries also. For example, a simple military exercise in India might be reported in Pakistani news as “India Preparing To Annex Kashmir”. While it is very difficult to filter through these headlines and get the actual news, we thought there could be a good middle ground. We can, through the use of sentiment analysis, find how different governments are represented in a certain country's media. For example, we could see how Putin is perceived in the media in USA vs. Russia vs. China. 
With this website, we want users to search up a media company and should be able to view:
- **A bais rating** ranging from hyper-partisan left to hyper partisan right
- **An reliability score** ranging from -10 to 10.
- **A list of entities/topics** which the media company talks or doesn't talk about
# Important Components: 
- **A search bar** where you can search the names of media houses or companies
- **Login functionality** where users can sign in and have their own personalized dashboard
- **Watchlists** where users can add entities of interest to be displayed on their webpage
